char_name hp: 34     -- shows info on char_name

-- Suggests to input params:
try d6> 4           -- "4" is entered by master (4 == success)
aim d6 1> 3         -- "3" is entered by master
aim d6 2> 5         -- "5" is entered by master
succeed, 14 trys    -- info calculated by the program
char_name hp: 34 - 14 = 20    -- program shows the impact
enemy_name: 1 more move       -- program shows there is one more move

-- Alternatively, chances can be generated by the program:
try d6>           -- No input from master, Enter pressed
auto try d6: 3
aim d6 1>         -- No input from master, Enter pressed
auto aim d6 1: 4
aim d6 2>         -- No input from master, Enter pressed
auto aim d6 2: 6
failed (missed)  -- info calculated by the program

-- Alternatively, enhanced try:
enemy enemy_name: throw fireball char char_name d8            -- d8 == try+1
try d8> 4

-- Alternatively, try 2nd syntax
enemy enemy_name: throw fireball char char_name try+0
try d8> 4

-- With aim:
enemy enemy_name: throw fireball char char_name d6 aim+1      -- d6 == try+0; aim+1
try d8> 6         -- +1 for aim
failed

enemy enemy_name: throw fireball char char_name try+0 aim+1   -- d6 == try+0, aim+1
try d10> 5      -- +1 for try +1 for aim
aim d4 1> 5
aim d4 2> 6

-- With aim traded for move:
enemy enemy_name: throw fireball char char_name try+0 aim/m   -- d6 == try+0, aim+1
enemy_name traded a move for aim
try d6> 1
aim d4> 1
aim d4> 1
failed (missed)


-- With aim traded for 2 moves (dexterity should be 6):
enemy enemy_name: throw fireball char char_name try+0 aim/2m   -- d6 == try+0, aim+2
enemy_name traded 2 moves for aim, autosuccess
try d6> 1
succeed (missed)
